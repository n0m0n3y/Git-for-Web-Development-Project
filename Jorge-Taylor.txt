    It can be used as many times as you would like but my personal opinion is it should only be used once in your code.

                  the only difference is that iD is very specific and unique and only usable once per element, also iDs have greater spesifity and trumps a class. while a class is not unique and can be used as many times as needed. iDs are like anchors and shouldn't be used for styling.
<ul id="somethingUni"></ul>   <a class="className"></a>

            (I could be wrong but I personally think of them like Methods in js since 
            they I guess have like a function inside them theres no need to declare or put
            anything inside them as they work as is. like :hover :link :visited once added to your code 
            the computers/browser already knows what to do when it sees them. (Again I could be wrong for sure lol)

         rm *fileName* Because once its gone its KIND OF gone, and takes alot of work to recover
         with forensic recovery software there is also other methods but in short it will
         be no easy task to do the recovery as it wont just be in the trash bin BUT unlike what has been
         stated nothing is ever 100% gone unless you maybe rewrite over the entire hard disk with 0s and still
         there ALWAYS a chance it can still be recovered.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
          block will take all width aval. while inline take only the required width.
          block elements are <p> <h1-6> <ul>, inline elements are your <a> <b> <i> <img>


    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    "An element that is absolutely positioned is taken out of the flow; thus, 
    other elements are positioned as if it did not exist. 
    The absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor" - stackOverFlow (Illtellyoulater)


    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
             inline?

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block         inline      inline-block
    1. <div>     1. <span>     1. <img>
    2. <h1-6>    2. <a>
    3. <nav>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    From my understanding the "Box model" in CSS is the layout so it will consist of the content in the center
    the padding around that, then the boarder and lastly the margin.
    The browser sees every element as a box according to CSS basic box model.
    As far as fix for the box model, im not sure what you mean.
